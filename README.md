# Visualizing Economic App for Higher Education Projekt
A Reposity of an analysed and craeted Projekt of a WebApp -
That was created with the solution of creating a sketch for a Webapplication -
which would help people with visualizing; "How they spend their money?" in a simple but effective way.
Created with the Framework of Flask, it's a local webserver that was only used to view the application on a local level -
but can be scaled to a higher approach by editing the **reading** and **initializing** of the SQL Database
